"2. The populations used to calculate standard age-adjusted rates are documented here: More information:"

"3. The method used to calculate age-adjusted rates is documented here: More information:"
"http://wonder.cdc.gov/wonder/help/ucd.html#Age-Adjusted Rates."
"4. Deaths for persons of unknown age are included in counts and crude rates, but are not included in age-adjusted rates."

"<br/><b>Note:</b> Rates and population figures for years 2001 - 2009 differ slightly from previously published reports, due to"
